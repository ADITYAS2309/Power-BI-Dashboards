# Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze sales performance, understand revenue drivers, and optimize business strategies using data-driven insights.

# Procedure

- A star schema is created with dim tables for dates, location and retailer and fact table for adidas sales. This was done in Power Query Editor, to add/remove columns, remove duplicates, create primary keys, merge queries, and so on. Relations between the tables were estabilished.

- After creating the schema, various measures were created using DAX, which were used in the different visualizations on the dashboard.
